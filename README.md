This is a twofold repository for our paper "*A Comprehensive Empirical Investigation on Failure Clustering in Parallel Debugging*", containing both complete conlusions and a replication package.


We provide **complete conclusions** comprising all 12 groups of REFs' clustering results: 

***
1. [A complete list of conclusions of RQ2]

- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (FMI) among 2-bug, 3-bug, 4-bug, and 5-bug scenarios
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (JC) among 2-bug, 3-bug, 4-bug, and 5-bug scenarios
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (PR) among 2-bug, 3-bug, 4-bug, and 5-bug scenarios
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (RR) among 2-bug, 3-bug, 4-bug, and 5-bug scenarios

***
2. [A complete list of conclusions of RQ3]
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (FMI) among TypeA, TypeP, and TypeH scenarios
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (JC) among TypeA, TypeP, and TypeH scenarios
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (PR) among TypeA, TypeP, and TypeH scenarios
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (RR) among TypeA, TypeP, and TypeH scenarios

***
3. [A complete list of conclusions of RQ4]
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (FMI) among various NSP1Fs
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (JC) among various NSP1Fs
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (PR) among various NSP1Fs
- The contrast of clustering effectiveness (RR) among various NSP1Fs

We also provide the **replication package** of this empirical study, which contains the used datasets (SIR and Defects4J) and source code.
